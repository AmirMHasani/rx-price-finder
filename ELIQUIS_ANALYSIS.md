## Accuracy Analysis

### Medicare Copay
⚠️ **MODERATELY HIGH** - App shows $135 vs Real $40-$54 (250% higher)

The app's Medicare copay is significantly higher than real-world averages. BMS (manufacturer) reports that Medicare patients pay an average of $54/month, with 5 out of 10 paying $40 or less.

### Cash Price  
✅ **WITHIN RANGE BUT HIGH** - App shows $1,592 vs Real $594-$833

The app's cash price is about 2x higher than typical retail prices. However, brand medication pricing varies widely by pharmacy, so this could represent high-end pharmacy pricing.

### Coupon Price
⚠️ **MODERATELY HIGH** - App shows $955 vs Real $587-$594 (160% higher)

The app's coupon price is significantly higher than GoodRx's best prices, which start at $587-$594 for 60 tablets.

## Overall Verdict
**MIXED ACCURACY** - Cash price is within reasonable range for brand medications (which vary widely), but Medicare copay and coupon prices are 2-2.5x higher than real-world averages.

## Possible Explanations
1. **Pharmacy Markup Variation:** Brand medications have much wider price variation than generics
2. **Medicare Plan Variation:** Different Part D plans have different copays (app may be showing higher-tier plan)
3. **Coupon Calculation:** App's coupon algorithm may not be optimized for expensive brand medications
4. **Data Source:** App may be using different data source than GoodRx for brand medications

## Recommendation
The app should review its pricing algorithm for brand medications, particularly:
- Medicare copays for Tier 3-4 brand drugs
- Coupon pricing for medications over $500/month
- Consider adding manufacturer copay card information (Eliquis offers $30 copay with card)
